Amazon Sales Analysis:


This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze Amazon sales data. The dashboard includes key metrics such as Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales, Overall-to-Date (OTD) Sales, YTD Product Sales, and Revenue breakdowns by month, week, and product. The goal was to provide a clear view of sales performance over time and across different products. Filters and visuals allow users to explore trends, compare periods, and identify top-performing items. This helps in making informed business decisions based on real-time sales insights.
